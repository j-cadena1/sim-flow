## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Browser   │────▶│   Nginx     │────▶│   Express   │
│             │◀────│  (TLS 1.3)  │◀────│   Backend   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                                              │
                    ┌─────────────────────────┤
                    │                         │
              ┌─────▼─────┐           ┌───────▼───────┐
              │ PostgreSQL│           │ Microsoft     │
              │ Sessions  │           │ Entra ID (SSO)│
              └───────────┘           └───────────────┘
```

**Local Authentication:**
1. User submits email/password to `/api/auth/login`
2. Backend validates credentials, checks lockout status
3. Session created in PostgreSQL, HTTP-only cookie set
4. Cookie includes `SameSite: strict` for CSRF protection

**SSO Authentication (Microsoft Entra ID):**
1. Frontend redirects to `/api/sso/authorize`
2. Backend initiates PKCE flow, stores state in database
3. User authenticates with Microsoft
4. Callback at `/api/auth/sso/callback` validates code
5. Session created, user redirected to frontend

### Authorization Model (4-Tier RBAC)

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full system access, user management, SSO configuration, audit logs |
| **Manager** | Approve/deny requests, assign engineers, manage projects, view reports |
| **Engineer** | Work on assigned requests, log time, update status (own requests only) |
| **End-User** | Submit requests, view own requests, add comments |

### Data Protection Layers

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|------------|
| **Transport** | TLS 1.2/1.3, HSTS with preload |
| **Session** | HTTP-only cookies, 24h expiry, max 5 per user |
| **Passwords** | bcrypt (12 rounds), minimum length enforced |
| **SSO Secrets** | AES-256-GCM encryption at rest |
| **Database** | Prepared statements, connection pooling |
| **Input** | Zod validation, DOMPurify sanitization |
| **Output** | CSP headers, X-Content-Type-Options |

## Operational Security Runbook

### Incident Response Checklist

**1. Detection**
- [ ] Check CSP violation logs: `docker compose logs backend | grep "CSP Violation"`
- [ ] Check failed login attempts: `docker compose logs backend | grep "Failed login"`
- [ ] Review audit logs in Settings > Audit Log

**2. Containment**
- [ ] Lock compromised accounts (Settings > User Management > Deactivate)
- [ ] Revoke all sessions for affected users:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id = '<user_id>';
  ```
- [ ] If SSO compromised, disable SSO temporarily:
  ```sql
  UPDATE sso_config SET enabled = false;
  ```

**3. Investigation**
- [ ] Export audit logs for timeframe
- [ ] Check login attempts table:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM login_attempts
  WHERE email = '<email>'
  ORDER BY attempted_at DESC LIMIT 50;
  ```

**4. Recovery**
- [ ] Reset affected user passwords
- [ ] Re-enable accounts after password reset
- [ ] Update SSO encryption key if compromised:
  ```bash
  # Generate new 32-character key
  openssl rand -base64 32
  # Update ENTRA_SSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY in .env
  # Restart services - users will need to re-authenticate
  ```

### Log Locations

| Log | Location | Contents |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Backend | `docker compose logs backend` | API requests, auth events, errors |
| Nginx | `docker compose logs frontend` | HTTP access, TLS errors |
| PostgreSQL | `docker compose logs postgres` | Query errors, connection issues |

### Session Management Commands

```bash
# View active sessions count
docker compose exec postgres psql -U sim-rq_user -d sim-rq \
  -c "SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) FROM sessions GROUP BY user_id;"

# Force logout all users
docker compose exec postgres psql -U sim-rq_user -d sim-rq \
  -c "DELETE FROM sessions;"

# Clear login lockouts
docker compose exec postgres psql -U sim-rq_user -d sim-rq \
  -c "DELETE FROM login_attempts WHERE successful = false;"
```

### Database Backup Security

```bash
# Create encrypted backup
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U sim-rq_user sim-rq | \
  gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gpg

# Restore from encrypted backup
gpg -d backup-20250101.sql.gpg | \
  docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U sim-rq_user sim-rq
```

## Penetration Test Scope

### In-Scope

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Local authentication
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Session termination
- `GET /api/sso/authorize` - SSO initiation
- `POST /api/auth/sso/callback` - SSO callback

**Authorization Testing:**
- Role-based access control on all `/api/*` endpoints
- Resource ownership validation (users can only access own data)
- Engineer assignment validation for time entries

**Input Validation:**
- All form inputs (request creation, comments, project data)
- File upload validation (type, size, content)
- SQL injection testing on all database queries

**Session Management:**
- Cookie security attributes
- Session fixation testing
- Concurrent session limits

**Security Headers:**
- CSP enforcement and bypass attempts
- Clickjacking via framing
- MIME type sniffing

### Out-of-Scope

- Microsoft Entra ID infrastructure (third-party)
- AWS/Cloudflare infrastructure (if applicable)
- Physical security
- Social engineering
- Denial of Service attacks

### Test Environment Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone repository and start dev environment
git clone <repo> && cd sim-rq
cp .env.example .env
make dev

# 2. Test credentials (development only)
# Admin: qadmin@sim-rq.local / (see QADMIN_PASSWORD in .env)
# Manager: bob@sim-rq.local / manager123
# Engineer: charlie@sim-rq.local / engineer123
# End-User: alice@sim-rq.local / user123

# 3. API documentation
# http://localhost:3001/api-docs
```

### Expected Security Controls

| Control | Expected Behavior |
|---------|-------------------|
| Rate limiting | 30 requests/15min on auth, 1000/15min on API |
| Account lockout | 5 failed attempts triggers 15-min lockout |
| Session expiry | 24 hours, max 5 concurrent sessions |
| CSRF protection | SameSite=strict cookies |
| XSS protection | CSP blocks inline scripts, DOMPurify on input |

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Verification

**Environment Variables:**
- [ ] `QADMIN_PASSWORD` changed from default (min 12 characters)
- [ ] `DB_PASSWORD` is strong and unique
- [ ] `ENTRA_SSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set (32+ characters)
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN` set to specific production domain
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] `SECURE_COOKIES=true` (if behind HTTPS proxy)

**Network Security:**
- [ ] Database port (5432) not exposed externally
- [ ] Redis port (6379) not exposed externally
- [ ] Only ports 80/443 exposed to internet
- [ ] Firewall rules restrict backend access to nginx only

**TLS Configuration:**
- [ ] Valid TLS certificate installed
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ enforced (no TLS 1.0/1.1)
- [ ] HSTS header present with long max-age
- [ ] Certificate auto-renewal configured (Let's Encrypt)

**Docker Security:**
- [ ] Images pulled from trusted sources
- [ ] No containers running as root (where possible)
- [ ] Secrets not in docker-compose.yaml (use .env)
- [ ] Volume permissions restricted

### Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Test security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com | grep -E "(Strict-Transport|Content-Security|X-Frame)"

# Verify HTTPS redirect
curl -I http://your-domain.com  # Should return 301 to HTTPS

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..35}; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/auth/login; done
# Should see 429 after 30 requests

# Verify CSP reporting
# Check backend logs after browsing the application
docker compose logs backend | grep "CSP Violation"
```

### Security Monitoring

- Enable log aggregation (ELK, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Set up alerts for:
  - Multiple failed login attempts (>10/hour per IP)
  - CSP violations (potential XSS attempts)
  - 5xx error spikes (potential attack)
  - Session creation spikes (credential stuffing)
