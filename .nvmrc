# This project is Docker-first!
# You don't need Node.js installed locally.
#
# Use these commands instead:
#   make dev          # Development with hot reload
#   make prod         # Production
#   make test         # Unit tests
#   make test-e2e     # E2E tests
#
# If you really need to run npm commands directly (not recommended):
# Node.js version used in Docker containers is specified in:
# - docker-compose.yaml: NODE_VERSION (default: 20)
# - docker-compose.dev.yaml: NODE_VERSION (default: 20)
